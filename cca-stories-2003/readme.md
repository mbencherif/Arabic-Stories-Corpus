# Corpus of Contemporary Arabic

researcher:  Latifa Al-Sulaiti


# description
The main purpose of my research is to develop a prototype Corpus of Contemporary Arabic (CCA). The target users of this corpus will be language teachers, language engineers, foreign learners of Arabic and material writers. The first step in designing my corpus is deciding on the text type to include in this corpus. For this reason I have developed a questionnaire to help me identify the suitable texts.

This text is only the stories category of CCA
